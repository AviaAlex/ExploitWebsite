          Do you want to know how to make a website like Neutron? Here is how. <br/>
          To get started, you will need a text editor with syntax highlighting. We recommend using <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code.</a> After, you will need to create some folders on your computer, and open those on your text editor. If you want to open a existing repository, (Only for Atom users, and GitHub repos only.) Click the GitHub icon at the bottom right, hit clone an existing repository, and paste the link you should have gotten when you created the repository. To get it again, simply click 'Code', and then copy the HTTPS link that pops up. After, you'll want to publish your code to GitHub. To do this on Atom, make sure the GitHub window is open. After, click Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac) to save the file. It should then pop up in the Unstaged Changes window. Select the file, and click Enter. Then, make a commit message in the menu, and then click Commit. Then, click Push to push the file to GitHub. Then you're done! To do this on VS Code, click the three dots on the top right, click 'Pull, Push' then click Push To then click Add Remote, then pase the HTTPS link mentioned above. Then login if neccesary. After that, you are done! Then, you are going to want to have a hosting provider. This is where Netlify comes in. It provides free hosting service. Create an account (prefferably with GitHub), then go to 'Sites', then click 'Add a new site', then click 'Import an existing project', then click GitHub, and then choose the repository mentioned. After that, rename your website, and then test it out before officially being done. If it all works with the code you put in, you are officially done and ready to release your site to the public! Thank you for following this guide, as it is one of the simplest guides I could make!
